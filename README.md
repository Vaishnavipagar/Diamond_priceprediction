# Diamond Price Prediction

## Project Overview
The **Diamond Price Prediction** project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on their attributes using machine learning techniques. This project helps buyers, sellers, and analysts estimate the price of diamonds accurately and make informed decisions.

## Features
- Predict diamond prices using various features like carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions.
- Interactive interface for inputting diamond characteristics.
- Provides estimated price along with confidence scores.
- Supports real-time predictions using a trained ML model.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Framework (Optional):** Flask or Streamlit for interactive interface

## Dataset
The dataset includes multiple attributes of diamonds:
- Carat
- Cut
- Color
- Clarity
- Depth
- Table
- Dimensions (x, y, z)
- Price

## Model
- Model Type: Regression (Random Forest / Linear Regression / XGBoost)
- Input: Diamond features
- Output: Predicted price

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diamond-price-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application (if using Streamlit or Flask):
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Input diamond attributes in the interface or console.
2. Get the predicted price instantly.
3. Optionally, visualize trends and feature importance using provided plots.

## Future Improvements
- Include more advanced ML algorithms for better accuracy.
- Deploy as a web application for broader access.
- Integrate historical market trends for more reliable predictions.
